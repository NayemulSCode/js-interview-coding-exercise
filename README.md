### Coding Exercise

#### 1. What is the output of below code

```javascript
var car = new Vehicle("Honda", "white", "2010", "UK");
console.log(car);

function Vehicle(model, color, year, country) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
  this.year = year;
  this.country = country;
}
```

- 1: Undefined
- 2: ReferenceError
- 3: null
- 4: {model: "Honda", color: "white", year: "2010", country: "UK"}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The function declarations are hoisted similar to any variables. So the placement for `Vehicle` function declaration doesn't make any difference.

#### 2. What is the output of below code

```javascript
function foo() {
  let x = (y = 0);
  x++;
  y++;
  return x;
}

console.log(foo(), typeof x, typeof y);
```

- 1: 1, undefined and undefined
- 2: ReferenceError: X is not defined
- 3: 1, undefined and number
- 4: 1, number and number

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

#### 3. What is the output of below code

```javascript
function main() {
  console.log("A");
  setTimeout(function print() {
    console.log("B");
  }, 0);
  console.log("C");
}
main();
```

- 1: A, B and C
- 2: B, A and C
- 3: A and C
- 4: A, C and B

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the fist statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

#### 4. What is the output of below equality check

```javascript
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);
```

- 1: false
- 2: true

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.

#### 5. What is the output of below code

```javascript
var y = 1;
if (function f() {}) {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

- 1: 1function
- 2: 1object
- 3: ReferenceError
- 4: 1undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

#### 6. What is the output of below code

```javascript
function foo() {
  return;
  {
    message: "Hello World";
  }
}
console.log(foo());
```

- 1: Hello World
- 2: Object {message: "Hello World"}
- 3: Undefined
- 4: SyntaxError

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

</p>

#### 7. What is the output of below code

```javascript
var myChars = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
delete myChars[0];
console.log(myChars);
console.log(myChars[0]);
console.log(myChars.length);
```

- 1: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], empty, 3
- 2: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], empty, 3
- 3: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4
- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

#### 8. What is the output of below code in latest Chrome

```javascript
var array1 = new Array(3);
console.log(array1);

var array2 = [];
array2[2] = 100;
console.log(array2);

var array3 = [, , ,];
console.log(array3);
```

- 1: [undefined × 3], [undefined × 2, 100], [undefined × 3]
- 2: [empty × 3], [empty × 2, 100], [empty × 3]
- 3: [null × 3], [null × 2, 100], [null × 3]
- 4: [], [100], []

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

The latest chrome versions display `sparse array`(they are filled with holes) using this empty x n notation. Whereas the older versions have undefined x n notation.
**Note:** The latest version of FF displays `n empty slots` notation.

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop1: function () {
    return 0;
  },
  prop2() {
    return 1;
  },
  ["prop" + 3]() {

};

console.log(obj.prop1());
console.log(obj.prop2());
console.log(obj.prop3());
```

- 1: 0, 1, 2
- 2: 0, { return 1 }, 2
- 3: 0, { return 1 }, { return 2 }
- 4: 0, 1, undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

ES6 provides method definitions and property shorthands for objects. So both prop2 and prop3 are treated as regular function values.

#### 10. What is the output of below code

```javascript
console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
```

- 1: true, true
- 2: true, false
- 3: SyntaxError, SyntaxError,
- 4: false, false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

The important point is that if the statement contains the same operators(e.g, < or >) then it can be evaluated from left to right.
The first statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
2. console.log(true < 3);
3. console.log(1 < 3); // True converted as `1` during comparison
4. True

Whereas the second statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
2. console.log(true > 1);
3. console.log(1 > 1); // False converted as `0` during comparison
4. False

#### 11. What is the output of below code in non-strict mode

```javascript
function printNumbers(first, second, first) {
  console.log(first, second, first);
}
printNumbers(1, 2, 3);
```

- 1: 1, 2, 3
- 2: 3, 2, 3
- 3: SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
- 4: 1, 2, 1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

#### 12. What is the output of below code

```javascript
const printNumbersArrow = (first, second, first) => {
  console.log(first, second, first);

printNumbersArrow(1, 2, 3);
```

- 1: 1, 2, 3
- 2: 3, 2, 3
- 3: SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
- 4: 1, 2, 1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Unlike regular functions, the arrow functions doesn't not allow duplicate parameters in either strict or non-strict mode. So you can see `SyntaxError` in the console.

#### 13. What is the output of below code

```javascript
const arrowFunc = () => arguments.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

#### 14. What is the output of below code

```javascript
console.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === "trimLeft");
console.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === "trimStart");
```

- 1: True, False
- 2: False, True

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

#### 15. What is the output of below code

```javascript
console.log(Math.max());
```

- 1: undefined
- 2: Infinity
- 3: 0
- 4: -Infinity

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

-Infinity is the initial comparant because almost every other value is bigger. So when no arguments are provided, -Infinity is going to be returned.
**Note:** Zero number of arguments is a valid case.

#### 16. What is the output of below code

```javascript
console.log(10 == [10]);
console.log(10 == [[[[[[[10]]]]]]]);
```

- 1: True, True
- 2: True, False
- 3: False, False
- 4: False, True

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

As per the comparison algorithm in the ECMAScript specification(ECMA-262), the above expression converted into JS as below

```javascript
10 === Number([10].valueOf().toString()); // 10
```

So it doesn't matter about number brackets([]) around the number, it is always converted to a number in the expression.

- 3: 1010, 10-10
- 4: NaN, NaN

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

The concatenation operator(+) is applicable for both number and string types. So if any operand is string type then both operands concatenated as strings. Whereas subtract(-) operator tries to convert the operands as number type.

- 2: True, I'm False
- 3: False, I'm True
- 4: False, I'm False

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

In comparison operators, the expression `[0]` converted to Number([0].valueOf().toString()) which is resolved to false. Whereas `[0]` just becomes a truthy value without any conversion because there is no comparison operator.

- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: 1,23,4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### 22. What is the output of below code

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.indexOf(NaN));
```

- 1: 4
- 2: NaN
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: -1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); // true
```

##### Answer: 3

When using rest parameters, trailing commas are not allowed and will throw a SyntaxError.
If you remove the trailing comma then it displays 1st answer

```javascript

- 2: 10
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: Promise {\<rejected\>: 10}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10);
}
```

- 2: 10
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: Promise {\<resolved\>: undefined}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined);
}
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Even though “processArray” is an async function, the anonymous function that we use for `forEach` is synchronous. If you use await inside a synchronous function then it throws a syntax error.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.

But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,

```javascript
async function processArray(array) {
  for (const item of array) {
    await delayedLog(item);
  }
  console.log("Process completed!");
}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Symbol follows below conventions,

1. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.
2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

**Note:** The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.

- 3: It is not a string!, It is a number!
- 4: It is a string!, It is a number!

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The return value of `typeof myNumber (OR) typeof myString` is always the truthy value (either "number" or "string"). Since ! operator converts the value to a boolean value, the value of both `!typeof myNumber or !typeof myString` is always false. Hence the if condition fails and control goes to else block.

<p>

##### Answer: 2

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 2

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});
```

2. **Assign default empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 } = {}) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area();
```

If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.

Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below,

1. The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number
2. The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively.

The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

##### Answer: 2

Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above function will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its **.then/catch/finally** handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.

**Note:** We call the above queue as "MicroTask Queue"

- 2: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a first line, and  print `Third line` as next line
- 3:  Missing semi-colon error
- 4:  Cannot read properties of undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called `Automatic Semicolon Insertion` which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.

```javascript
console.log('First line')['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))
```

Hence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.

##### Answer: Output in the following order:
```javascript

 Even though the second timeout function has a waiting time of zero seconds, the javascript engine always evaluates the setTimeout function using the Web API, and therefore, the complete function executes before the setTimeout function can execute.

```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: Output will be {name: “Mahmudul”}

Adding objects as properties of another object should be done carefully.
Writing x[y] = {name:”Saheb”} , is same as writing x[‘object Object’] = {name:”Saheb”} ,
While setting a property of an object, javascript coerces the parameter into a string.
Therefore, since y is an object, it will be converted to ‘object Object’.
Both x[y] and x[z] are referencing the same property.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: Outputs in the following order-

```javascript
11
0
Nan
2-22
NaN
Hello78
```

When JavaScript sees that the operands of the expression x + y are of different types ( one being a number type and the other being a string type ), it converts the number type to the string type and then performs the operation. Since after conversion, both the variables are of string type, the ‘ + ‘ operator outputs the concatenated string “33” in the first example and “24Hello” in the second example.

Note - Type coercion also takes place when using the ‘ - ‘ operator, but the difference while using ‘ - ‘ operator is that, a string is converted to a number and then subtraction takes place.

##### Answer: 

```javascript
true
false
false
true
false
false
false
false
```

NaN property represents the “Not-a-Number” value. It indicates a value that is not a legal number.

typeof of NaN will return a Number.

To check if a value is NaN, we use the isNaN() function,

Note- isNaN() function converts the given value to a Number type, and then equates to NaN.

(function (a) {
    return (function () {
        console.log(a);
        a = 20;
    })()
})(59);
```

#### 71. Guess the outputs of the following codes(this keyword): 

```javascript
var obj = {
    name: "Nayemul",
    getName: function () {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}
var getName = obj.getName;
var obj2 = { 
    name: "Omra Haque", 
    getName 
};
obj2.getName();
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: output will be "Omra Haque"

The “this” keyword refers to the object that the function is a property of(.)

The value of the “this” keyword will always depend on the object that is invoking the function.

Although the getName function is declared inside the object obj, at the time of invocation, getName() is a property of obj2, therefore the “this” keyword will refer to obj2.

The silly way to understand the “this” keyword is, whenever the function is invoked, check the object before the dot. The value of this . keyword will always be the object before the dot.

Note: If there is no object before the dot, the value of this keyword will be the global object. example
```javascript
function doSomething() {
  console.log(this);
}
doSomething();
```
output
```javascript
Window {window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: '', location: Location, …}
```

#### 72. Guess the outputs of the following codes(this keyword): 

```javascript
var obj1 = {
    address: "Mohammadpur, Dhaka-Bangladesh",
    getAddress: function () {
        console.log(this.address);
    }
}

var getAddress = obj1.getAddress;
var obj2 = { name: "Nayemul saheb" };
obj2.getAddress();
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: output will be an error.

```javascript
Uncaught TypeError: obj2.getAddress is not a function
```
Although in the code above, this keyword refers to the object obj2, obj2 does not have the property “address”‘, hence the getAddress function throws an error.

#### 73. What will the following code output?: 

```javascript
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: output will be  false.

This will surprisingly output false because of floating point errors in internally representing certain numbers. 0.1 + 0.2 does not nicely come out to 0.3 but instead the result is actually 0.30000000000000004 because the computer cannot internally represent the correct number. One solution to get around this problem is to round the results when doing arithmetic with decimal numbers.

#### 74. How would you check if a number is an integer? write solution for those result.

```javascript
console.log(isInt(4)); // true
console.log(isInt(12.2)); // false
console.log(isInt(0.3)); // fals
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer:

```javascript
function isInt(num) {
  return num % 1 === 0;
}
```

A very simply way to check if a number is a decimal or integer is to see if there is a remainder left when you divide by 1.
